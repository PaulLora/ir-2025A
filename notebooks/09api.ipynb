       " \"\\nThink!\\n\\nIt's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...\\n\\nThe SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices\\nit is attached when it wants to.\\n\\nAn important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the\\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\\n\\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\\n\",\n",
